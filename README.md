# Pawsitive Care – Premium Dog Care Website

This project includes a complete 4-page-style site (plus supportive assets) for a premium dog care business named 'Pawsitive Care'. The design focuses on trust, calmness, and a welcoming user experience across devices.

What’s included
- Home (index.html): Hero section with a high-quality dog photo, a gallery of happy dogs, and a testimonials section.
- Services (services.html): Grooming, Daycare, Training with Add to Cart buttons.
- Cart (cart.html): Dynamic cart view with item removal and total.
- Checkout (checkout.html): Final total and a mock PayPal Sandbox button to simulate payment.
- About (about.html): Company story and values.
- Contact (contact.html): Contact form with validation and success message.
- A shared header/footer across pages for visual consistency.
- Responsive, mobile-first layout with scroll reveal animations and interactive UI.
- A simple cart persistence in localStorage included in JS.

How to run
- This is a static HTML-based prototype intended for demonstration. For a real deployment, integrate a backend or use a static site hosting service.
- Ensure you load the files in a single directory structure with subfolder 'js' for JavaScript assets.

Notes
- All inline styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes. For fonts, placeholders {{font: Font Name}} indicate where fonts should be loaded by the server-side templating system.
- All images use placeholder format: src='https://pixabay.com/get/g5c746533ba39f49b923e01668ba0eca9a90ff41a270b6f8346b0601184fb6c94cf6d2f7c7c9b5f8e6ab04e261cd6cea6e2e34e58c697a1e8f760f99e4b9b8e2e_640.jpg' and should be replaced with real assets in production.
- The current year is 2025 and is inserted into copyright notices as required.
